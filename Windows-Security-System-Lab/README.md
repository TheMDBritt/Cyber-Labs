# Windows Security & System Administration Lab

## Overview

This lab demonstrates hands-on Windows system administration and cybersecurity fundamentals aligned with cybersecurity and systems administration roles. The focus is on **account management, system security, monitoring, reliability, and documentation**—skills required to support secure and reliable enterprise environments.

All tasks were performed in a Windows virtual machine to simulate a real operational environment.

## Lab Breakdown

### Phase 1: Identity, Users, and Audit

* Verified current user and privilege context
* Audited existing local user accounts
* Created a controlled test user
* Disabled and re-enabled the account to simulate offboarding/onboarding
* Verified account actions in Windows Security logs

**Skills demonstrated:**

* Identity & Access Management (IAM)
* Least privilege principles
* Audit logging and accountability

### Phase 2: System Security & Reliability

#### Endpoint Protection

* Verified Microsoft Defender status and real-time protection

#### Patch Awareness

* Reviewed installed Windows updates and recent patches

#### Service Availability

* Checked critical services for logging, updates, and endpoint protection

#### Network Availability & Exposure

* Verified IP configuration and outbound connectivity
* Reviewed listening ports to assess attack surface

#### Firewall Posture

* Reviewed Windows Firewall profiles and default policies

**Skills demonstrated:**

* Endpoint security verification
* System availability monitoring
* Host-based firewall awareness
* Basic network exposure analysis

---

### Phase 3: Inventory, Baseline, and Monitoring

#### System Inventory

* Collected OS and system baseline information
* Reviewed installed software for inventory awareness

#### Performance & Reliability

* Checked system uptime
* Identified top CPU- and memory-consuming processes

#### Change Tracking

* Reviewed recent system updates
* Analyzed recent system event logs for errors and warnings

**Skills demonstrated:**

* Configuration management awareness
* Performance monitoring
* Change and event analysis

## Evidence Collection

Screenshots of each step were captured and stored to document:

* Commands executed
* System states observed
* Security controls verified

This mirrors real-world audit and documentation practices.
